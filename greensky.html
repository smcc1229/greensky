    <div class="my-class">I found greensky at a late night set
      at Horning's Hideout.At first I just casually liked them.
      I saw them play a free show at a local records store.
      They played for a whole hour! It blew me away and I was
      made a fan for life. They are a pure joy to see live.
      The band has a lot of fans. Us fans are called campers :)
      As in happy campers</div>
